# Dynamic Power BI Performance Report

This repository contains the Power BI project files for a dynamic performance report designed to analyze key metrics and identify potential growth areas for a fictional company. I created this report as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills in Power BI, DAX, and data visualization.

## Project Goal

The primary objective was to build a comprehensive, interactive report that provides actionable insights through clear and concise visualizations. I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in:

* Data transformation and modeling using Power Query.
* Creating complex DAX measures, including time intelligence and switch measures.
* Designing visually appealing and user-friendly reports.
* Implementing conditional formatting to highlight critical data points.

## Project Structure

The project is broken down into four key phases:

1.  **Data Preparation (Power Query):** I imported and cleaned data from Excel files, created relationships between tables, and built a date table for time-based analysis.
2.  **Model Building (DAX):** I developed various DAX measures, including sales, gross profit, YTD, PYTD, and switch measures for dynamic metric selection. I also utilized ChatGPT to refine and optimize my DAX code.
3.  **Visualization (Report Design):** I focused on creating a visually engaging report with clear and impactful charts and tables. I implemented conditional formatting to highlight key performance indicators and created dynamic titles for user interaction.
4.  **Review and Publication:** I thoroughly tested the report from an end-user perspective before publishing it to the Power BI service.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Metric Selection:** Switch measures allow users to easily switch between different performance metrics.
* **Conditional Formatting:** Key performance indicators are highlighted using conditional formatting, making it easy to identify areas of concern.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** The report features interactive charts and tables that allow users to drill down into the data.
* **Clear and Concise Design:** The report is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand.
* **Dynamic Titles:** Report titles update based on user selections.

## Technologies Used

* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Excel
* ChatGPT (for DAX assistance)

## Getting Started

1.  Download the Power BI project file (.pbix) from this repository.
2.  Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3.  (Optional) If you want to replicate the data import process, download the provided Excel files.
4.  Explore the report and interact with the visualizations.

## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in Power BI and DAX. I learned the importance of:

* Thorough data preparation and cleaning.
* Writing efficient and optimized DAX code.
* Designing reports with a focus on user experience.
* Utilizing conditional formatting to highlight key insights.

## Future Improvements

* Implement more advanced DAX measures for deeper analysis.
* Incorporate additional data sources.
* Add more interactive elements to the report.
* Create more visual enhancements.

## Special Thanks

I would like to extend a special thanks to Mo Chen and her wife for their support and encouragment throughtout this project. Their insights and feedback were invaluable.
